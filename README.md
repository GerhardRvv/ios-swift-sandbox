# SwiftUI Prototype Project

This project is a collection of exercises and examples built to demostrate the fundamentals of SwiftUI, a modern UI framework for building iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications using declarative syntax.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
The purpose of this repository is to demostrate:
- The basics of SwiftUI and its declarative syntax.
- Core SwiftUI components such as `Views`, `Modifiers`, `State`, `Binding`, and `Environment`.
- Building reusable, composable views.
- Manage data flow within a SwiftUI application using `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@Environment`.

### Features
The project consists of the following modules:
1. **Building a Basic UI**: Created a simple user interface with various SwiftUI components, such as `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, `Stack` views, and learned how to apply `Modifiers` to customize the look and feel.
2. **Handling User Input**: Explored the basics of data binding using `@State` and `@Binding` to handle user inputs in a dynamic and responsive way.
3. **Composing Complex Interfaces**: Learned to create and structure reusable views, allowing the application to scale in complexity while maintaining readability and modularity.
4. **Navigation and Presentation**: Implemented navigation within the app, including hierarchical navigation with `NavigationView` and modal presentations.
5. **Working with Lists and Data**: Built dynamic lists using `List` and `ForEach` to display data-driven interfaces. Practiced data fetching, sorting, and filtering techniques.
6. **Using Advanced Data Handling**: Leveraged `@Environment` and `@EnvironmentObject` to manage data flow across views, exploring more advanced ways to maintain a single source of truth in the application.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **SwiftUI Views and Modifiers**: Understanding how to create and modify views.
- **Data Flow**: Using `@State`, `@Binding`, `@Environment`, and `@EnvironmentObject` to handle data across views.
- **Composability**: Building views that can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Navigation**: Adding navigation stacks and tab views to create a more structured app layout.
- **List Management**: Creating dynamic lists of items and handling user interaction within lists.
- **User Input**: Capturing user input and responding to changes interactively.

## Requirements
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5.7+
- iOS 16+ (or later)
